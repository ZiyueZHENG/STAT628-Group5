# STAT 628 BodyFat Project Introduction


This project is the coursework for STAT 628 module 2, in which we construct and compare statistical models for body fat calculating and build a basic bodyfat calculator based on R shiny app.


There are four folders providing more details in our main project: Data, Code, R shiny, Image


## Files and Folders
- `\Data` contains the raw data and precessed data.

- `\Code` provides R code files for data cleaning, model selection, diagnostic and R code for building the calculator.

- `\Image` contains the plots we get through model diagnostic.
