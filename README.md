# STAT 628 BodyFat Project Introduction


This project is part of the coursework for STAT 628 module 2, in which we constructed and compared statistical models for the calculation of body fat percentage and then built a basic bodyfat calculator based on the R shiny app.


There are four folders providing more details for our main project: Data, Code, R shiny, Image.


## Files and Folders
- `\Data` contains the raw data and precessed data.

- `\Code` provides R code files for data cleaning, model selection, diagnostic and R code for building the calculator.

- `\Image` contains the plots we get through model diagnostic.

- `Summary` contains the summary of our results.

- `Readme`
